# Stock Picker

## Description

This program takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day and it returns a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.
## What have I learnt?

Iâ€™ve learnt more about the #each_with_index method, nothing else really.
## Technologies

For this project the only language that was used was **Ruby.**
