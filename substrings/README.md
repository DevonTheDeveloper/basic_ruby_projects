# Substrings

## Description
A simple substrings project, this project scans a sentence and counts how many times words from the given dictionary are in there.
## What have I learnt?

Iâ€™ve learnt about two new methods, `#scan` and `#count`, this was a pretty basic project though.
## Technologies

For this project the only language that was used was **Ruby.**


## Roadmap

- [x]  Allow case-insensitive input
- [x]  Display results in a hash
- [x]  Handle multiple words
- [x]  Count & identify matches
- [x]  Return results
