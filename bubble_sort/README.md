# Bubble Sort

## Description

This project is bubble sort, which is one of the simpler ways of sorting a group of items in an array, where each element is compared to the one next to it and they are swapped if the one on the left is larger than the one on the right. This continues until the array is eventually sorted.
## What have I learnt?

Iâ€™ve learnt more about problem solving and using loops from this project, I find that these projects are small but powerful.
## Technologies

For this project the only language that was used was **Ruby.**
